# cline_template
Scaffold for vibe-coding projects with [Cline](https://cline.bot/)

After cloning, `mv cline_template $NEW_PROJECT_NAME` && `rm -rfv .git` to create a new name and delete the git history for the template.

Then, edit [memory-bank/projectbrief.md](memory-bank/projectbrief.md) to taste and run `initialize memory bank` from Cline cli within vscode.
